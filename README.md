The `printf` function sends formatted output to `stdout`. A custom `_printf()` for learning purposes was developed by cohort #18 students Nura Aliyu and Donald Mogaka. The `_printf()` function's format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any of these arguments are placed using the percentage `%` operator.
